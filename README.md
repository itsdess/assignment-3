my first repository on GitHub
Something new that I have been learning is Arabic. I take Arabic 101 on Saturdays at Umass Boston. At first I was only taking the course to fulfil my requirements to graduate in May but as months passed I am actually starting to like the class more than I expected. Taking this class is difficult due to me being bilingual already but I love how I am pushing myself to challenge myself. Hopefully by the end of the semester I have a better understanding and knowledge about the language.
